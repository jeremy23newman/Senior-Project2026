# Senior-Project2026


## Overview
In this project, I will spend the beginning duration creating several basic plugins, like gain, overdrive, bitcrush, delay, and compressor.
Then for the final project I will take the basic plugins made and combine into an original plugin utilizing the plugins aforementioned.

## Technologies Used
- **JUCE Framework** – Audio plugin development
- **C++** – Core programming language
- **Logic Pro** – Plugin host for testing (AU format)
- **Xcode** – macOS build environment
- **Projucer** – Project configuration

### Individual Plugins
Each effect will be implemented as a standalone plugin:
- **Gain** – Signal amplitude control and gain staging
- **Bitcrusher** – Bit depth and sample rate reduction
- **Delay** – Time-based effect using circular buffers
- **Compressor** – Simulated acoustic space using delay networks
- **Distortion** – Nonlinear waveshaping and harmonic generation

## Project Timeline

### Phase 1: Research and Basic Implementation (Weeks 1–7)
- Learn JUCE framework fundamentals
- Review DSP concepts relevant to audio effects
- Configure development environment (JUCE, Xcode, Logic Pro)
- Implement Gain plugin
- Implement Bitcrusher plugin
- Implement Delay plugin
- Implement Compressor plugin
- Implement Distortion plugin
- Test each plugin independently in Logic Pro

### Phase 3: Final Multi-Effect Plugin (Weeks 8–15)
- Integrate all effects into one plugin
- Optimize performance and stability
- Implement any other features that would enhance design
- Final testing in Logic Pro
- Bug fixes and performance improvements
- Documentation and final project submission
